This script is a simplified version of one used on getthere.ie;
I've removed caching of results, and the script is called asynchronously on the live site. It might be a good idea to add back caching if you'll be making a lot of requests.

You are welcome to add your own dublinked scripts to this repository in other languages, and if you want to collaborate on getthere.ie, give me a shout at eoghan@getthere.ie
